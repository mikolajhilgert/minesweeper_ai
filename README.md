# minesweeper_ai
For our decision theory project, we opted to construct an Artificial Intelligence system in the form of a rational agent for the Minesweeper game. Employing a value iteration approach, we developed an abstract policy that enables our agent to achieve an average win rate of 3 to 4 times higher than that of a random agent.
